   Your chatbot will now be live and ready to chat with you!
## ü§ñ How It Works

The application uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite** to process and answer questions based on the content of a PDF document. Here's how it works:

- **User Uploads PDF:** Upload one or more PDF files to the web application.
- **Text Extraction:** The content of the PDF is extracted using PyPDF2 and split into smaller chunks.
- **Vector Store Creation:** The text chunks are embedded using Google Generative AI Embeddings and stored in a FAISS vector database.
- **User Query:** When the user asks a question, the application performs a similarity search in the vector store to find relevant text and generates an AI response based on that context.

## üìö Future Improvements
While the application is functional, here are a few ways we can enhance it further:


- **Support for Multiple File Types:** Extend the app to support additional file formats like Word and Excel.
- **Advanced AI Models:** Experiment with more advanced AI models for better understanding of document context.
- **Search Features:** Add search features to allow users to browse document content before asking questions.
- **Real-time Document Processing:** Automatically update the vector store when a new document is uploaded.

## üöÄ Future Scope

- **Multi-Document Processing:** Enable users to upload multiple documents at once and interact with content across different PDFs.
- **Improved User Interface:** Make the UI more interactive and user-friendly for better accessibility.
- **Integration with Cloud Storage:** Allow users to upload PDFs directly from cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox.
- **AI-based Summarization:** Implement summarization features to provide brief overviews of long documents.

## üåç Why Use This Chatbot?

his application helps users get quick and accurate answers from any uploaded PDF document without having to read through pages of content. It's useful for a variety of scenarios such as:

- **Research Papers:** Quickly extract key points and answers from scientific papers.
- **Manual & Guides:** Find relevant information in technical manuals without manually searching.
- **Contracts and Legal Documents:** Extract specific clauses and terms from lengthy contracts or agreements.
- **Educational Content:** Ask questions about textbooks, study materials, and learning resources.
